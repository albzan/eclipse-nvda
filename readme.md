To do so, proceed as follow:
* Open the Eclipse IDE
* Open the Window Menu (ALT-W)
* Choose the "Preferences" item
* Tab to the tree view
* Navigate to General, then to Editors, Text Editors, Annotations
* Press TAB to move to the list of annotations

For each annotation you can choose:
* Three check boxes (Vertical ruler, Overview ruler and Text As)
* A combo box that indicates how the annotation is presented in the text (Available when the Text check box has been selected).

Set annotations as follow:

* **Breackpoints**: Text As Check Box selected, then TAB and choose "highlighted" from the combo box.
* **Errors**: Text As Check Box selected, then TAB and choose "highlighted" from the combo box.
* **Info**: Text As Check Box Unselected
* **Matching tags**: Text As Check Box Unselected
* **Occurrences**: Text As Check Box Unselected
* **Search Results**: Text As Check Box Unselected
* **Warnings**: Text As Check Box selected, then TAB and choose "highlighted" from the combo box.

## NVDA 2019.2 and next behavior
if you don't like the new NVDA behavior in Eclipse, expetially if you are using a braille display and you don't want to have the line hidden by autocompetition each time **ContentAssist** pops-up, you can enable the old behaviour of NVDA.
In this way, you can access **ContentAssist** pressing the **TAB** key.
To do this, edit the eclipse.py file of this addon, and set the **OLD_BEHAVIOR** variable to **True** .
